# Test-Driven Development Tutorial

We follow Giordani's "Clean Architectures in Python" to practice TDD. 

I suggest you use PyCharm for this tutorial.

Install the dependencies. If you are using PyCharm, the easiest way to install the dependencies is to open 
the `requirements.txt` file and click "Install requirement". 
See [this page for the reference](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/managing-dependencies.html#apply_dependencies).
