# Test-Driven Development Tutorial

We follow Giordani's "Clean Architectures in Python" to practice TDD. See [this repo](https://github.com/pycabook/calc) for the project template.

```
docker build -t se-tdd . 
```

I suggest you use PyCharm for this tutorial. See [this internal document](https://www.notion.so/smuhci/Using-Docker-Python-30daecda21eb42db967223ee0c83096f) for setting up PyCharm.
